# Spirits TODO List

CURRENT
[15:15:52 ERROR]: Could not pass event EntityDamageEvent to Spirits v1.1d
java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke "com.projectkorra.projectkorra.ability.CoreAbility.getElement()" because "ability" is null
        at com.projectkorra.projectkorra.BendingPlayer.canUsePassive(BendingPlayer.java:331) ~[ProjectKorra-1.9.3.jar:?]
        at me.numin.spirits.listeners.Passives.onFallDamage(Passives.java:29) ~[Spirits-1.1d-PK1.9.3.jar:?]

1.1:
- Fix up all basic abilities
- Redo Possess
- Add SpiritBlast
- Changed the passive into a passive ability
- Light/Dark Spirits are now given the Spirit element as well when they choose
- Overridden PK's chat to fix Spirits showing as avatar
- Added %spirits_element% PAPI placeholder that fixes spirits showing as Avatars
1.2:
- Re-add Corrupt and Purify
  - They can only convert spirits on low health
  - The player's concentration can be broken by being damaged
  - Spirits can break out the whirlpool
  - Spirits will be converted on death
  - The chance of a spirit breaking out is related to their health (needs work)
  - Current break system idea:
    - The starting health gives a player/mob more chances to break out
    - Extra chances are decided by:
      - The initial health
      - While the health is above the HealthBase (X), multiply the health by a multiplier (Y)
      - For each loop, chances++
      - E.g. X = 4, Y = 0.6, So 20 health = 20 -> 12 -> 7.2 -> 4.32 -> 2.59 (now under the HealthBase, so there are 4 extra chances)
      - Each time they attempt to break out, there is a chances/40 chance to break out
    - Mobs try break out every second.
1.3:
- Replace Shelter with Trail
  - Leaves a trail of healing wherever you go
  - Can be used to heal yourself or other players
  - Can be toggled into a death zone by clicking
- Add Dark Spirit bomb ability
  - Place bombs that are ALMOST invisible to other players
  - Bombs are very visisble to the player who placed them (glowing entities maybe?)
  - Can be detonated to cause life steal damage to all within range
  - Explosive and have knockback
